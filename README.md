## Plugin Installation

Plugins are NOT included in this download. When you open the application go to the Update tab and install the plugins you want; or update one if an update is available.

If you are a developer and want to distribute your own plugins and have update availability then you must have them hosted online somewhere. You will need to make a VERSION.json file that can be added to a sources list in the application.

The format of the file is as follows:

``` javascript
{
    "PluginInfo": {
        "Name": "Plugin.Name.dll",
        "Version": "3.0.5145.29167",
        "Files": [
            {
                "Name": "Plugin.Name.dll",
                "Location": ""
            },
            {
                "Name": "Logo.png",
                "Location": ""
            },
            {
                "Name": "PluginInfo.xml",
                "Location": ""
            }
        ],
		"SourceURI": "http://url/to/base/directory/of/download"
    }
}
```

If you have other files they can be added into that structure. If they are in sub-directories the the location would be something like this:

``` javascript
{
    "PluginInfo": {
        "Name": "Plugin.Name.dll",
        "Version": "3.0.5145.29167",
        "Files": [
            {
                "Name": "Plugin.Name.dll",
                "Location": ""
            },
            {
                "Name": "Logo.png",
                "Location": ""
            },
            {
                "Name": "PluginInfo.xml",
                "Location": ""
            },
			{
				"Name: "Some.ext",
				"Location: "path/to/sub/folder"
			}
        ],
		"SourceURI": "http://url/to/base/directory/of/download"
    }
}
```

The location will not have a leading or trailing slash.
